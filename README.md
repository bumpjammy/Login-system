# Login system

This project allows the user to login and register

## Features

- User can login and register an account
- Stored in an SQL database

## What I learned

- Redirects using Flask
- Handling POST requests with Flask
- Returning basic pages with Flask
- Handling databases in back-end web development

## Potential improvements

- Encrypted passwords (stored in plaintext currently)
- Better resulting pages (just returns text to the user currently)
